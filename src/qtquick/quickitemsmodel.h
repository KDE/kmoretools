/**
 * @short A model which shows the contents found in an Engine
 *
 * Use an instance of this model to show the content items represented by the configuration
 * file passed to an engine. The following sample assumes you are using the Engine component,
 * however it is also possible to pass a KNSCore::Engine instance created from C++ to this
 * property, if you have specific requirements not covered by the convenience component.
 *
 * Most data in the model is simple, but the DownloadLinks role will return a list of
 * DownloadLinkInfo entries, which you will need to manage in some way.
 *
 * You might also look at NewStuffList, NewStuffItem, and the other items, to see some more
 * detail on what can be done with the data.
 *
 * @see NewStuffList
 * @see NewStuffItem
 * @see NewStuffPage
 * @see NewStuffEntryDetails
